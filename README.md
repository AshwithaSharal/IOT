PIR Sensor:<br>
PIR sensors allow you to sense motion, almost always used to detect whether a human has moved in or out of the sensors range. They are small, inexpensive, low-power, easy to use and don't wear out. For that reason they are commonly found in appliances and gadgets used in homes or businesses. They are often referred to as PIR, "Passive Infrared", "Pyroelectric", or "IR motion" sensors.<br>
Working:<br>
The passive infrared sensor does not radiate energy to space. It receives the  infrared radiation from the human body to make an alarm. Any object with temperature is constantly radiating infrared rays to the outside world. The surface temperature of the human body is between 36° C - 27 ° C and most of its radiant energy concentrated in the wavelength range of 8 um-12 um.<br>
In the detection area, the lens of the detector receives the infrared radiation energy of the human body through the clothing and focused on the pyroelectric sensor. When the human body moves in this surveillance mode, it enters a certain field of view in sequence and then walks out of the field of view. The pyroelectric sensor sees the moving human body for a while and then does not see it, so the infrared radiation of human body constantly changes the temperature of the pyroelectric material. So that it outputs a corresponding signal, which is the alarm signal.<br>
